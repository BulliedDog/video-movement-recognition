# Video Movement Recognition and Prediction
### Abstract  
This code analyses frames in videos to detect any moving object and will predict it's position with various techniques.

### TODOS:  
- [] Extraction of frames from video.
- [] Detection of movement between subsequent frames by making frame subtractions.
3. Detection of contour to determine similarity to mosquitoes.
4. Differentiation between a possible human contour and a mosquitoe's
5. Analysis on times and efficiency of calculation, both for detection and prediction of movement (this prediction will be necessary to command possible actuators).
